### Introduction

I have seen a lot of tweets on my feed about power and effect size. I wanted to think about those things carefully, so I did some reading and am writing down some thoughts. An interesting paper that I read on this is [here](http://www.stat.columbia.edu/~gelman/research/unpublished/power.pdf) The takeaway is that studies that are underpowered, yet still obtain statistically significant results, will tend to overestimate the effect size.

### Simulations

Let's imagine that we are doing a hypothesis test of $\mu = 0$ versus $\mu \not = 0$, and our underlying population is normal with mean 1 and standard deviation 10. If we take a sample of size 30 and test at the $\alpha = .05$ level, then our power is
